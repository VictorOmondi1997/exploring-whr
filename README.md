# Exploring the World Happiness Report

<center> Data Cleaning, Data Aggregation and Data Visualization</center>

World Happiness Report is an annual report created by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network with the intent of guiding policy. The report assigns each country a happiness score based on the answers to a poll question that asks respondents to rank their life on a scale of 0 - 10.

It also includes estimates of factors that may contribute to each country's happiness, including economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity, to provide context for the score. Although these factors aren't actually used in the calculation of the happiness score, they can help illustrate why a country received a certain score.

* How can aggregating the data give us more insight into happiness scores?
